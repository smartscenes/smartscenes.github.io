In our efforts to work on semantic understanding of 3D scenes we have built software and tools for visualizing and designing 3D scenes on the web, and performing semantic annotation of 3D data.

The SmartsScene Toolkit code is a centralized repository of many of our tools and can be downloaded from: https://github.com/smartscenes/sstk
